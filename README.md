# üìò GIT Exam Result Checker

This is a Python script that automatically checks **General Information Technology (G.I.T.) exam results** from the official exam website.  
It scans through a range of index numbers, extracts the details, and saves them into a text file (`results.txt`).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.x** installed  
   - Check if Python is installed:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
   - If you don‚Äôt have it, download from üëâ [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Pip** (Python package manager) installed  
   - Check with:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```
   - Pip usually comes with Python, but if missing, install it separately.

3. Required libraries:  
   Install using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
